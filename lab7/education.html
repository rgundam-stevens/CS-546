                        <h2> St Paul's High School </h2>
                        <p>My favourite class in this school was Biology 
                        </p>
                    <aside> 
                         NCC selections were held in my school, when I heard this I was bit confused at first 
                         but decided to participate in the selections not expecting anything. I told my 
                         classmates to join with me and they too agreed for it. My parents to encouraged me 
                         to join NCC which was a plus point for me. I did not know much about it, so it was 
                         a fresh experience. At the day of selections there were so many young aspiring 
                         students of our school who wanted to join NCC; we were tested by some physical and mental 
                         activities by our ANO sir and our senior cadets. It was a tough competition, 
                         but i was glad that i was selected. I was into some new experience and I was 
                         filled enthusiasm. I firstly thought this wasn’t my cup of tea, then later on 
                         started enjoying each and every parade.

                    <aside> 
                    The beautiful campus, daily morning worship, the hostel prayer cell groups, 
                    the amazing staff and students makes a deep, lasting impact on the lives of all the 
                    students.I have seen my friend from Karunya University truly “Rise & Shine” all over the world.

                        <p>My favourite course in this university is Project Management fundamentals</p>
                    <aside> 
                     At Stevens I got to see the Davidson Lab and learn about the history of Stevens.I’ve always 
                     had a love for the environment and animals, and because I do not get to see it in my major, 
                     I enjoy taking part in events that give me the opportunity to either learn more or help 
                     the environment.
