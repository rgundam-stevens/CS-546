                <h1>A spooky encounter</h1>
                
                    <p> The year was 2016.It was a Monday night in June.My friends and I had been out and I was the
                        designated driver (so yes, I was sober). I had just dropped the last one of my friends at 
                        their house and was driving myself home.It was a route I’d taken many times before.As I was 
                        driving I noticed a silhouette of a person standing in the road.There was nothing remarkable 
                        about it. A lean person of average height.However despite the street lights, I assure you it’s 
                        pretty dark at night. They don’t do a good job.The car I was driving was old (built in 2002) 
                        and the headlights were not particularly bright.Back to our silhouette. At first I didn’t think
                        much of it. Entirely unremarkable from a distance.There are intoxicated vagrants who 
                        frequent parks in this area, so I assumed this silhouette was one of these guys.
                    </p>
                    
                    
                    <p> After approaching the silhouette for a few seconds, I noticed “the guy” wasn’t moving, just
                        standing his ground in the lane I was driving.I though to myself that this guy must be truly
                        wasted if he’s playing chicken with cars at 1am.I put on high beams to get a better look but
                        because of a combination of my old cars crappy head lights and the angle of the road and the
                        general darkness of the road, that the high beams didn’t really help much and I couldn’t 
                        really see more.I slowed down as I had no intention of hitting a pedestrian and slowly 
                        approached “the drunk vagrant”.As I approached my high beams were getting closer to the
                        silhouette, kind of like a torch approaching it’s target.Just as our “drunk vagrant” was 
                        about to get “into the spotlight”, as it were, he/she/it jumped.From a standing position
                        in one leap.Across the remainder of my lane, across the entire opposite lane and landed
                        well onto the pavement on the other side of the road.And as if by magic was gone.
                    </p>
                    
                    
                    
                    <p>
                        Now I’m a terrible judge of distance, and I’ve never bothered to actually measure
                        it so I won’t guess a number as to the total distance of a jump.What i will say,
                        is that I sure as hell can’t jump that far with a run up, let alone from a standing
                        position.According to Google, the world record for long jump is 8.95m (29ft 2.5in).
                        I would imagine that this is a bit more than our friendly drunk “vagrants” leap, 
                        however keep in mind that long jumpers have a run up.Fortunately for me, the stop sign, 
                        visible from Google Street view, wasn’t there in those days, otherwise I would’ve broken 
                        one more rule of the road on the way home.If a ghost, why bother to jump? If not a ghost, 
                        then WHAT?I have no idea what I saw that night, but doubt it was human.
